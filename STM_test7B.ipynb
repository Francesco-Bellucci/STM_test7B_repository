This is achieved by gathering data from sensors in real-time, allowing for ongoing monitoring of component performance and condition over time. Predictive Maintenance strategies can be developed using Anomaly Detection techniques, that use Machine Learning algorithms to identify abnormal patterns or behaviors in data that may indicate potential issues. The idea of simultaneously increasing equipment availability while reducing maintenance costs has generated significant interest from industry stakeholders. Depending on the specific use cases, predictive maintenance offers notable benefits, including increased machine uptime, reduced maintenance hours and material used, as well as enhanced stability in machine outputs, shorter lead times, and fewer forced outages. In this paper, we propose a condition monitoring method for gearboxes based on vibration, ultrasound, and oil analysis. To achieve this, an effective anomaly detection algorithm is necessary to detect faults at an early stage and facilitate timely maintenance actions. Our proposed analysis extensively evaluates Test7B, a gearbox test bench. Throughout its lifecycle, numerous inspections have been conducted to generate a supervised dataset for training and testing real-time Anomaly Detection models. The aim is to compare the sensitivity and robustness of different approaches. Additionally, if the Anomaly score exceeds a certain threshold for a specified period, more focused techniques such as Time Series Analysis (TSA) or envelope analysis for ultrasonic sensors are applied to classify the anomaly with greater accuracy.\"\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SEOFl9-QhUx9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Keywords: Condition monitoring, ultrasonic data analysis, predictive maintenance, pattern recognition, Anomaly Detection."],"metadata":{"id":"TgT16fmkhiMn"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"EYX70FaEQ0T7"},"outputs":[],"source":["#from google.colab import drive\n","#drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Percorso del file\n","#file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Dottorato/PdM CoMo and Anomaly Detection/'\n","\n","# Caricamento del file CSV utilizzando pandas\n","#df = pd.read_csv(file_path)"],"metadata":{"id":"WOLxE4TNsHN0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Installazione e autorizzazione del Kaggle API"],"metadata":{"id":"CFAqMlZZlw3K"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install kaggle\n","\n","from google.colab import files\n","files.upload()  # Carica il file kaggle.json generato dal tuo account Kaggle"],"metadata":{"id":"i0H0emaTzUqo","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":324},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709742679663,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":27156,"user":{"displayName":"Francesco Bellucci","userId":"04811525109360076788"}},"outputId":"702a6bbb-8a93-4d06-98c7-e2b864cdb0b3"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: kaggle in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (1.5.16)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.10 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (1.16.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2024.2.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (4.66.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-slugify in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (8.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: bleach in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (6.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: webencodings in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bleach->kaggle) (0.5.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: text-unidecode>=1.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-slugify->kaggle) (1.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->kaggle) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->kaggle) (3.6)\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-922958fe-f51b-474e-947e-ab7a8b82952a\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-922958fe-f51b-474e-947e-ab7a8b82952a\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
